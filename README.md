# Statistics Coursework

The files in this repository relate to coursework solutions produced during a course in Statistics. The original questions can, for obvious reasons, not be disclosed here. However, a brief summary of the intent behind each of the R files is given below.

## paphos

The aim was to fit a linear regression analysis with estimated plant-available phosphorus (PAphos) as response. The two explanatory variables were inorganic phosphorus (inorg) and organic phosphorus (org).

## turnip

The aim was to investigate the differences in mean yields (in tonnes per hectare) of three different types of turnips using ANOVA.
